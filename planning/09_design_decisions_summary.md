# Design Decisions Summary

This document consolidates all major design decisions made across the planning documents to provide a single reference for implementation.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Database & Persistence
- **Single embedded Kuzu database** for prototype simplicity
- **Hybrid composition storage**: on-demand computation with caching
- **Automatic identity morphism management** 
- **Full explicit functor mapping storage**
- **Manual backup functionality** through GUI

### User Experience & Interface
- **Single-user application** focus
- **Form-based editing** with separate visualization views
- **Manual save with transaction support**
- **Desktop-optimized design** (Chrome browser primary)
- **Light/dark theme support** only

### Mathematical Validation
- **Permissive mode** - structural constraints enforced, mathematical laws validated but not strictly enforced
- **Tool functionality prioritized** over mathematical rigor
- **Preventative error handling** where possible

### Visualization System
- **PyVis-based** graph visualization
- **Commutative diagram layout** following category theory conventions
- **100-entity pagination** for large graphs
- **LaTeX integration** for mathematical notation
- **Animated transitions** between visualization modes
- **Accessibility support** for color blindness

### Development Approach
- **Single-developer** sequential development
- **Student/teaching tool** primary use case
- **Standalone application** deployment model
- **Windows development environment** with Chrome testing
- **Classical mathematical examples** for testing

## Feature Prioritization

### Must-Have (MVP)
- Category, object, morphism CRUD operations
- Basic visualization of category structures  
- Transaction commit/rollback functionality
- Functor and natural transformation presentation

### Nice-to-Have (Future)
- Mathematical law validation
- 3D visualization capabilities
- Performance optimization for large scales
- Advanced export/import features
- Collaborative editing features

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Performance Targets
- Database operations: <100ms simple, <500ms complex
- Visualization generation: <10 seconds for <100 nodes
- Support up to 100 categories, 10,000 objects/morphisms

### Testing Approach
- **Comprehensive testing** with high coverage
- **Property-based testing** using hypothesis for mathematical laws
- **Visual regression testing** for PyVis outputs
- **Chrome-only browser testing** for prototype

### Configuration & Logging
- **TOML configuration files** with GUI interface
- **Dual-level logging**: production (warnings/errors) and debug modes
- **Manual cache reset** options in advanced settings

## Remaining Open Questions

None - all critical design questions have been resolved with specific recommendations for prototype implementation.

## Implementation Readiness

The planning phase is complete with clear decisions for all major architectural and design questions. The project is ready to proceed with the implementation phases as outlined in the timeline document.
