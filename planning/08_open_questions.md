# Open Questions and Design Decisions

## Critical Design Questions

### 1. Mathematical Rigor vs Usability
**Question**: How strictly should the application enforce category theory laws?

**Options**:
- **Strict Mode**: Enforce composition laws, identity laws, naturality conditions
- **Guided Mode**: Validate but allow violations with warnings
- **Permissive Mode**: Focus on structure, minimal mathematical validation

**Impact**: Affects complexity of validation code, user experience, and target audience

**Recommendation Needed**: Define target user expertise level

### 2. Functor Mapping Granularity
**Question**: How detailed should functor object/morphism mappings be?

**Options**:
- **Full Explicit**: Store every object and morphism mapping
- **Rule-Based**: Store mapping rules, compute specific mappings on demand
- **Hybrid**: Explicit for small categories, rule-based for large ones

**Impact**: Database size, query performance, user interface complexity

### 3. Composition Handling
**Question**: How should morphism composition be managed?

**Options**:
- **Explicit Storage**: Store composite morphisms as separate entities
- **On-Demand Computation**: Calculate compositions when needed
- **Hybrid**: Cache frequently used compositions

**Impact**: Database schema, query performance, mathematical accuracy

### 4. Identity Morphism Management
**Question**: Should identity morphisms be automatically managed?

**Options**:
- **Automatic**: Create/delete identity morphisms automatically with objects
- **Manual**: User explicitly creates identity morphisms
- **Optional**: User can choose automatic or manual mode

**Impact**: Database consistency, user workflow, validation complexity

## User Experience Questions

### 5. Transaction Granularity
**Question**: What should be the scope of transactions?

**Options**:
- **Session-Based**: All edits in one transaction until commit/rollback
- **Entity-Based**: Each entity edit is a separate transaction
- **Batch-Based**: Related edits (e.g., creating category with objects) in one transaction

**Impact**: User workflow, error recovery, database performance

### 6. Visualization Complexity
**Question**: How much detail should visualizations show by default?

**Options**:
- **Minimal**: Show only essential structure
- **Detailed**: Show all relationships and properties
- **User-Configurable**: Let users choose detail level

**Impact**: Visual clarity, performance, user learning curve

### 7. Error Handling Strategy
**Question**: How should mathematical constraint violations be handled?

**Options**:
- **Preventive**: Disable invalid operations in GUI
- **Reactive**: Allow invalid states but highlight errors
- **Mixed**: Prevent obvious errors, warn about complex violations

**Impact**: User experience, code complexity, mathematical accuracy

## Technical Architecture Questions

### 8. Database Schema Evolution
**Question**: How should schema changes be managed as the application evolves?

**Options**:
- **Migration Scripts**: Formal database migration system
- **Version Detection**: Detect and upgrade old schemas automatically
- **Manual**: Document manual steps for schema updates

**Impact**: Deployment complexity, data preservation, maintenance overhead

### 9. Visualization Performance
**Question**: How should large graphs be handled in visualization?

**Options**:
- **Pagination**: Show subsets of large graphs
- **Level-of-Detail**: Simplify distant nodes, detail on zoom
- **Clustering**: Group related entities into clusters
- **Lazy Loading**: Load visualization data incrementally

**Impact**: User experience with large datasets, rendering performance

### 10. Plugin Architecture
**Question**: Should the system support extensibility?

**Options**:
- **No Plugins**: Fixed functionality, simpler architecture
- **Simple Hooks**: Allow custom validation or visualization functions
- **Full Plugin System**: Extensible entity types and operations

**Impact**: Code complexity, maintainability, future flexibility

## Implementation Priority Questions

### 11. Feature Prioritization
**Question**: Which features are essential for MVP vs future releases?

**Essential (MVP)**:
- Basic CRUD for categories, objects, morphisms
- Simple visualization
- Transaction commit/rollback

**Important (Phase 2)**:
- Functors and natural transformations
- Advanced visualization options
- Mathematical validation

**Nice-to-Have (Future)**:
- Import/export functionality
- Advanced mathematical tools
- Collaborative features

### 12. Testing Depth
**Question**: How comprehensive should the initial test suite be?

**Options**:
- **Basic**: Core functionality tests only
- **Comprehensive**: High coverage including edge cases
- **Mathematical**: Include property-based testing for mathematical laws

**Impact**: Development time, code quality, maintenance burden

## User Workflow Questions

### 13. Guided vs Free-Form Creation
**Question**: Should the GUI guide users through mathematical construction?

**Options**:
- **Wizard-Based**: Step-by-step guided workflows
- **Form-Based**: Traditional forms with validation
- **Mixed**: Guided for beginners, free-form for experts

**Impact**: User experience, code complexity, target audience

### 14. Visualization Integration
**Question**: How tightly should visualization be integrated with editing?

**Options**:
- **Separate Views**: Edit in forms, view in visualization tab
- **Integrated**: Edit directly in visualization (drag-and-drop)
- **Dual Mode**: Support both approaches

**Impact**: Implementation complexity, user preference accommodation

## Questions Requiring User Input

### 15. Target Users
- **Academic Researchers**: Need mathematical rigor and export capabilities
- **Students**: Need guided learning and validation
- **Software Developers**: Need practical tools and performance

### 16. Use Cases
- **Teaching Tool**: Focus on clarity and educational features
- **Research Tool**: Focus on mathematical accuracy and advanced features
- **Practical Tool**: Focus on performance and workflow efficiency

### 17. Integration Requirements
- **Standalone Application**: Self-contained tool
- **Jupyter Integration**: Work well in notebook environments
- **Web Deployment**: Support deployment to web servers

## Decision Framework
