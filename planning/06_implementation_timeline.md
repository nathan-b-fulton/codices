## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Kuzu Database Complexity**: PyVis integration may be more complex than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple visualizations, build complexity gradually

2. **Streamlit Limitations**: Streamlit may not support all desired UI patterns
   - **Mitigation**: Research Streamlit capabilities early, have fallback UI approaches

3. **Mathematical Validation Complexity**: Enforcing category theory laws may be computationally expensive
   - **Mitigation**: Implement validation as optional features, focus on structural correctness first

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Mathematical domain may introduce additional requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to original specification, document any proposed changes

2. **Performance Issues**: Graph operations may be slower than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Early performance testing, optimization sprints planned

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### External Dependencies
- `kuzu`: Graph database engine
- `streamlit`: Web app framework
- `pyvis`: Graph visualization
- `pytest`: Testing framework

### Internal Dependencies
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (DAL must be functional)
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 (need entities to visualize)
- Phase 4 can be developed in parallel with Phase 3
- Phase 5 depends on all previous phases

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements Met
- [ ] All entity types can be created, edited, deleted
- [ ] Visualizations display correctly for all modes
- [ ] Transaction system works reliably
- [ ] Mathematical constraints are enforced appropriately

### Quality Requirements Met
- [ ] >90% test coverage for DAL
- [ ] All planned documentation complete
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Code follows Python best practices

### User Experience Requirements Met
- [ ] Intuitive GUI for mathematical users
- [ ] Responsive interface with good error handling
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for all operations
- [ ] Comprehensive help and documentation

## Questions for Timeline Refinement

1. **Resource Allocation**: Is this a single-developer project or will there be multiple contributors?

   single-developer

2. **Mathematical Expertise**: Is mathematical validation a priority, or should we focus on tool functionality first?

   tool functionality

3. **Deployment Target**: Should we plan for local development only, or include deployment planning?

   local development only

4. **User Testing**: Should we include time for user feedback and iteration cycles?

   no

5. **Feature Prioritization**: Which features are must-have vs nice-to-have for the first release?

   Graph editing and basic visualization are the must-have core priorities, including effective presentations of categories, functors, and natural transformations. Nice-to-haves include validation using mathematical principles, 3d visualization, and performance optimization at scale can be deferred to later development stages.

6. **Maintenance Planning**: Should we include ongoing maintenance and feature extension planning?

Yes
